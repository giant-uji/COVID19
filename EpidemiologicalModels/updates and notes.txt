BEARmod update schedule

0.81 - 10 March 2020
 - Major speed increase in infection 
 - added capacity for multiple timesteps per day. TSinday defaults to 1, but defines the number of timesteps per day in the model (must be integer)
 - added capacity for a probability of moving per timestep (fitting to Vodafone data). Not accounted for if prob_move_per_TS = 0

0.7 - 8 March 2020
 - Added capability for a proportion of exposed people to be infectious--involves "exposed_pop_inf_prop" parameter added into runSim(). Defaults to zero.

Features to be added:
- Keep track of imported/local cases (This is kept track of on a daily basis already through nInfMovedToday)
- Move transmission parameters to a Parameters list, for simplicity of input data
